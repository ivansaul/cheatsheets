# Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

Try to observe the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
principle.

Do your absolute best to avoid duplicate code. Duplicate code is bad because it
means that there's more than one place to alter something if you need to change
some logic.

Imagine if you run a restaurant and you keep track of your inventory: all your
tomatoes, onions, garlic, spices, etc. If you have multiple lists that you keep
this on, then all have to be updated when you serve a dish with tomatoes in
them. If you only have one list, there's only one place to update!

Often you have duplicate code because you have two or more slightly different
things, that share a lot in common, but their differences force you to have two
or more separate functions that do much of the same things. Removing duplicate
code means creating an abstraction that can handle this set of different things
with just one function/module/class.

Getting the abstraction right is critical. Bad abstractions can be worse than
duplicate code, so be careful! Having said this, if you can make a good
abstraction, do it! Don't repeat yourself, otherwise you'll find yourself
updating multiple places any time you want to change one thing.

**Bad:**

```python
from typing import List, Dict
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class Developer:
    def __init__(self, experience: float, github_link: str) -> None:
        self._experience = experience
        self._github_link = github_link

    @property
    def experience(self) -> float:
        return self._experience

    @property
    def github_link(self) -> str:
        return self._github_link


@dataclass
class Manager:
    def __init__(self, experience: float, github_link: str) -> None:
        self._experience = experience
        self._github_link = github_link

    @property
    def experience(self) -> float:
        return self._experience

    @property
    def github_link(self) -> str:
        return self._github_link


def get_developer_list(developers: List[Developer]) -> List[Dict]:
    developers_list = []
    for developer in developers:
        developers_list.append({
            'experience': developer.experience,
            'github_link': developer.github_link
        })
    return developers_list


def get_manager_list(managers: List[Manager]) -> List[Dict]:
    managers_list = []
    for manager in managers:
        managers_list.append({
            'experience': manager.experience,
            'github_link': manager.github_link
        })
    return managers_list


## create list objects of developers
company_developers = [
    Developer(experience=2.5, github_link='https://github.com/1'),
    Developer(experience=1.5, github_link='https://github.com/2')
]
company_developers_list = get_developer_list(developers=company_developers)

## create list objects of managers
company_managers = [
    Manager(experience=4.5, github_link='https://github.com/3'),
    Manager(experience=5.7, github_link='https://github.com/4')
]
company_managers_list = get_manager_list(managers=company_managers)
```

**Good:**

```python
from typing import List, Dict
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass

        self._experience = experience

    @property
    def experience(self) -> float:
        return self._experience

    @property
    def github_link(self) -> str:
        return self._github_link


def get_employee_list(employees: List[Employee]) -> List[Dict]:
    employees_list = []
    for employee in employees:
        employees_list.append({
            'experience': employee.experience,
            'github_link': employee.github_link
        })
    return employees_list


## create list objects of developers
company_developers = [
    Employee(experience=2.5, github_link='https://github.com/1'),
    Employee(experience=1.5, github_link='https://github.com/2')
]
company_developers_list = get_employee_list(employees=company_developers)

## create list objects of managers
company_managers = [
    Employee(experience=4.5, github_link='https://github.com/3'),
    Employee(experience=5.7, github_link='https://github.com/4')
]
company_managers_list = get_employee_list(employees=company_managers)
```
