# Introduction

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book
[*Clean
Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
, adapted for Python. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software in Python.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be
universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are
ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of *Clean
Code*.
